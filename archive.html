<h1>Tristan's Blog</h1>

<p>
I write about interesting things I'm thinking or working on.
Mostly I talk about programming but I also digress into power user computer tricks, hardware and random things I'm interested in.

<h1>All Posts</h1>
<p>
  Posts in <strong>bold</strong> are ones I put significant effort into and endorse as still interesting and high quality.
